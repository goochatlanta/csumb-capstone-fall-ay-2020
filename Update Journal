I looked over the tables by doing the mysql script I wrote. 
Select * from events limit 10. I looked over the name of the columns. 
I will continue to look more before Wednesday. 


I installed the mysql workbench and tried to run the code from events in the gitlab. 
but I have an error. I will work with my teammates to figure out the problem. 
I also tried to download the mysql-connector-python but it won't let me install. 
Again, I will ask my teammate if they have successfully installed it.
