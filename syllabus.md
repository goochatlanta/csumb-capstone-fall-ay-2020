# Fall Capstone agenda

## Overview

Characterize the topical focus of media reports about Chinese activities and relationships around the world using GDELT 2.0 data. The thematic focus of media reports from the `Mentions` table can be captured through GDELT's themes in the `GKG` table or cameo codes in the `Events` table. The core comparison in the research project will be to compare the emotional tone of major regional topics across the different sources of media reports, e.g., Local reports, Chinese reports, and Western/American reports. The change in emotional tone across the core comparison over time will also be a fascinating investigation. Our `Events` and `Mentions` tables from GDELT 2.0 stored in the AWS start in March 2015 and extends until May 2019. The `GKG` table should extend until the start of the Fall 2019.  

A vital feature of this internship is that you are creating reproducible research. Reproducible research means that someone can use your code to pull data, analyze the data, and create the visualizations that exactly replicate what you did â€” no blackholes of analysis.

## Structure

**First**, the developing world will be split up into four areas. One for each student. 

1. Southeast Asian and South Pacific
2. South and Central Asia
3. East Africa
4. West Africa

**Second**, investigate trends in the media about China and the locale of focus:

1. Investigate media from the region. What are the primary news sources? What coverage of China and Chinese activities exist? What are the major themes covered? What themes pertain to China? What are the emotional tones?
2. Investigate Chinese media about the locale, Xinhua particularly. Which areas are addressed by Chinese media and which are omitted? What theme are covered by the Chinese press for the general region and specific locale? What are the emotional tones? 
3. Investigate American media about the area, generally, and China and the locale, specifically. What themes are American media coverage about the region? Which locale is the American media not covering? Is the American press covering Chinese activities in the locale? What are the emotional tones?

**Third**, compare trends in the local, Chinese, and Western media about the locale of focus. 

1. For Chinese activities in a locale, covered by local, Chinese, and Western media, does the emotional tone of the reporting different or similar relative to the reporter? What if the reporting was broken up by theme or cameo code? How does emotional tone change over time?  
2. If one of the reporters is missing (e.g., no Western or Chinese or local reporting) repeat the above analysis for two of the reporters. 

## Outputs

### Throughout the Capstone

**Work Journal** that describes daily work. Create a LASTNAMEworkjournal.md in your folder. Ensure that your journal entry is easy to read, using complete sentences. Hyperlink to current coding and graphs. This is the journal entry format I am seeking:

>## Date
>
>**Daily hours:** number, **Cumulative hours:** number 
>
>Then write up a summary of the day (1-2 sentences.)
>
>### Issues/problems
>- Issue 1 (a sentence)
>- Issue 2 (a sentence)

### At the end of the Capstone

**Blog** details the final version of your process and results for each of the three steps in *Structure* section of this syllabus. Your blog will also include an overview of the Capstone goals and the GDELT data. If you want, Eric can make your blog accessible to the public so that you can use it as a reference in your job search in the spring.
