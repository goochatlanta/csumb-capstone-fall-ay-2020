# 12/4/19 Zoom Meeting

Home stretch! Thanks for all of your work. I'll check with Eric about you all coming to NPS on Tuesday. 

Items to wrap up the semester capstone: 

1. Full dataset
2. List of all local sources

The full dataset should look like this (I included Afganistan and Armenia in this long table):

# 11/29/19 Zoom Meeting

Diego has all of his local and Western sources completed and is working on the Chinese sources. Sutter has been using his generator to create many tables. Sutter has found that countries like South Sudan have relatively few sources - but after looking at South Sudan, it seems like there is even less Western coverage of Chinese activities there. Sutter also found a strange connection between Mozambique and news coverage from Macau - this should be examined in the long-run. 

Next Thursday, I am presenting our research to an undergraduate class in Development Economics. I am asking them to read these articles by one of my favorite China experts, Dr. Westad - [Has a new Cold War really begun?](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-03-27/has-new-cold-war-really-begun) from 2018 and [Sources of Chinese Conduct](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-08-12/sources-chinese-conduct) from 2019. 

By next Wednesday, Sutter and Diego think that they can have an updated .csv file for all the countries done up to that point. Then, either Sutter will host the map on his server, or I will use the .csv file to demonstrate our data for the class. 

I am starting to write up an essay on our findings that I will submit to a foreign policy magazine in the next month or so. Trends in the dataset you have made will be front and center in the article!

# 11/20/19 Zoom Meeting

The **Dashboard** is looking good! Congrats! The finished product will effectively present the information that you have calculated. 

My suggestions regarding the Dashboard: 

- Make 7 maps
- Include an "about" page

The 7 maps would be: 
1. Chinese tone
2. Western tone
3. Local tone
4. Difference between Chinese and Western tone (or visa versa)
5. Chinese - local tone (or visa versa)
6. Western -local tone (or visa versa)
7. Ratio of (Chinese - local tone) over (Western - local tone), this can be reversed or inverted if you like

The "about" page, include: 
1. A paragraph that describe the overall goal of the project.
2. A pargraph about the work your group did during the fall semester Capstone. 
3. Include the 10 Western sources (and link to research about their origin) and 5 Chinese sources that were used across the comparisons. Also explain how you determined the local tone for the analysis. 

Next steps - complete the data wrangling for the whole sample of countries at the confidence level (0).

# 11/8/19 Zoom Meeting

It looks like Diego has come across the first country with out local news reports on Chinese activities in Bangladesh. Let's see what his full set of sources looks like before we make a call on - *no local perspective*.

To review what I think would be a "best practice", please include the following in your country folder: 
- 5 .csv tables of the comparable perspectives
- list of final local sources used
- full list of sources that report on the activites of Chinese actors in your country

Next Wednesday, you are scheduled to talk with Eric at 1 pm about the app. He thinks that you should have an idea of what the app should look like before that Wednesday discussion, at least superficially. 

Sutter has narrowed the GKG themes down to the top 100 for the Chinese, Local, and Western reporters. Next, he will construct the average tone by reporter for the top themes. 

# 11/6/19 Zoom Meeting

*Review of work*: You have all made a great start on the tables for your first (and second) countries. Sutter is working on narrowing down the relevant themes from the GKG. 

*Going forward*: It seems like a good way to organize all the information that you are about to create is to have a folder for each country. Within each country folder, please include the .csv files of tables for confidence intervals 0, 30, ... 100. Additionally, will you please include the list of local sources chosen and the list of top sources from which you picked out those local sources. 

Eric and I spoke yesterday afternoon about the final product for your project. He liked the idea of an **app/dashboard** that creates an interface with the data using a program like Python Dashboard or R Shiny. We can discuss this on Friday. Additionally, we would like to set up a time for you all to come back to NPS to present for work to Eric and me. 



# 11/1/19 Zoom Meeting

We have results for South Africa, Nigeria, Philippines, and India! Next steps:

1. Restrict confidence levels to 30, 50, 70, and 100 (thanks, Max)
2. Keep a list of your top local sources. 
3. Expand to new countries in your region. 

# 10/25/19 Zoom Meeting

By next Wednesday, 10/30, please have completed the table below for South Africa, India, and Thailand. (Max, I think your top country was Thailand, right?)

**Example: Table for South Africa**

News | # Articles | Mean tone | Standard deviation in tone |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
5 Chinese sources| *total number* | *avg. tone* | *s.d. in tone* |
10 Western sources |  *total number* | *avg. tone* | *s.d. in tone* |
Top South African/African sources |  *total number* | *avg. tone* | *s.d. in tone* |

Use the following criteria:

1. Restrict Chinese sources to 5 sources: Xinhua, China Daily, china.org, ecns, and People's Daily 
2. Use the local news sources that you find in the top 10 sources for your country. If a lot of Chinese, Western, or weird investment sources fill up your top 10 rankings, please look beyond the top 10 to the top 20 to identify local news sources. Keep a list of which sources you consider local. Let's include regional news sources as local news. For example, **AllAfrica.com** is excellent as a local news source for African countries. However, I'll look into whether or not **IndiaTimes.com** is good sources for other South Asian countries besides India (**India is not a fan of China while Pakistan and Bangladesh are.**)
3. Confidence level 0-100. We will not restrict the confidence level at all for this first table. 

To create the mean tone and standard deviation in tone, please follow this example. Say you find that there are 500 event mentions from the 5 Chinese sources. Execute the Python function [mean()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-statistics-mean-function/) across the float variable MentionDocTone for all the 500 mentions - this will give you the average (mean) tone for your Chinese sample. Then, execute the Python function [stdev()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-statistics-stdev/) across the float variable MentionDocTone for all the 500 mentions to get the standard deviation in tone for the Chinese sample. 

The part of this that is going to require some thought and documentation is the way you choose the local sources. Please keep track of what local sources you chose and why. We want all three of you to use the same method for picking the top local sources. 

Thanks so much!  Let's get some results!

# 10/23/19 Zoom Meeting (after thoughts...)

Our project is really moving along! Accessing the `GKG` table is difficult and confusing. It may be possible to query the `GKG` table for the specific urls that interest us, that is the Chinese news, the top 10 Western news, and the local news. However, even if we access the `GKG` table, the multiple themes for one article is likely going to cause us a headache. Since we only have a month and a half, I propose that we put the `GKG` table queries on hold. 

Let's get the "easy" stuff done well!

With the `events` and `eventmentions` tables, we can quantify the average tone of articles by Chinese, Western, and local sources. Also, in order to have the ability to determine whether or not the tone is different between sources, we need to have some information on sample of articles. 

**Table for one country**

Source | # Articles | Mean tone | Standard deviation in tone |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
Top Chinese | *total number* | *avg. tone* | *s.d. in tone* |
Top Western |  *total number* | *avg. tone* | *s.d. in tone* |
Top Local  |  *total number* | *avg. tone* | *s.d. in tone* |

Then we will do that for multiple confidence levels.

# 10/9/19 Zoom Meeting

### Progress

Sutter made a lot of progress for our project. He created multiple python files and indexed some variables. 

1. Python file to tally the number of events for which China is either the country code of Actor 1 or Actor 2 and the target country is the geo-reference country code for the event. 
2. Python file to tally the new sources of the events for South Africa and China. *South Africa was the East African country with the most Chinese events.*

### Next steps

Next steps follow are about the sources, themes, and tones:

1. Which sources are South African, which are Chinese, and which are the top 10 most influential sources in America, according to this [study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2989719). *Chris has a json file in his folder that names and used these sources.* 
2. What is the average tone of the news coverage about Chinese-South African events by type of source (Chinese, South African, and Top 10) in the `eventmentions` tables?
3. Of those thousands of events for which China is an actor and South Africa in the location, what are the most common themes from the `gkg` table?
4. Across for the top themes for Chinese-South African events, what is the tone of coverage by Chinese, South African, and Top 10 news source in the `gkg` table?

# 10/4/19 Zoom Meeting

Sutter indexed the *ActionGeo_CountryCode*, which uses the FIPS 10-4 country code abbreviation. He also created a query against the `event` for Chinese actors in Botswana and returned 2700 events. It will be interesting to see who is reporting on those events in the `eventmentions` table.  

By next Wednesday, will you please run Sutter's query for Chinese actors in your target countries. To return the number of events per country, like the 2700 events that Sutter found for Botswana. 

Will you please also...
- test to see if you get a different number of events if instead of *ActionGeo_CountryCode* you use a different variable to locate the target country. For example, China is *Actor1_CountryCode* and Botswana is *Actor2_CountryCode* or Botswana is *Actor1_CountryCode* and China is *Actor2_CountryCode*. These are all indexed. You can also try *Actor1Geo_CountryCode* and China is *Actor2Geo_CountryCode* but I don't think these are indexed yet. 
- calculate the average *NumSources* for the event found in your country in the `events` table. 
- generate a list of the top 10 news sites that are reporting on the events. This query will use the articles from the `eventsmentions` table. This will help with our next step in the analysis, which is to find the average tone of reports for Chinese news sources, American news sources, and local news sources. Chris and Sebastian put in a lot of time figuring out how to locate the news source. Please check out their journals and blogs on this. 

Thanks guys!

# 10/2/19 NPS Meeting

Great in-person meeting today. 

First, I provided an overview of the end product that I am interested in. Here is the simplified table that encompasses the analyses for each country. 

**Table title: Relative tone and theme of coverage about Chinese activities in target country** 

--- | Xinhua News | American News | Target Cntry News 
--- | --- | --- | ---
Theme #1 | Avg. tone (# articles) | Avg. tone (# articles) | Avg. tone (# articles) 
Theme #2 | Avg. tone (# articles) | Avg. tone (# articles) | Avg. tone (# articles) 
Theme #3 | Avg. tone (# articles) | Avg. tone (# articles) | Avg. tone (# articles) 

Find the **one** country in your group of countries with the most coverage of Chinese activities across the three types of news sources. This is the experimental phase for your queries and analysis.

Notes: 
- The `eventmentions` table provides the news source.
    - Xinhua news can also include China Daily if we decide on that.
    - American news is the top 10 sources, according to this [study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2989719). Chris has a json file in his folder that names and used these sources. 
    - Target Country news is going to require some investigation. Often the website ends with the country's two-letter code. 
- The `events` table provides the location of the event via *Actor1Geo_CountryCode, Actor2Geo_CountryCode, ActionGeo_CountryCode*. 
    - The *Geo_* variable is a FIPS 10-4 country code. 
- The `GKG` table provides the theme and tone. 

Second, we discussed how to link the `eventmentions`, `events`, and `GKG` tables. Here is the [query](https://blog.gdeltproject.org/complex-queries-combining-events-eventmentions-and-gkg/) from GDELT's website that illustrated the ID relationships.
    - You may want to begin your analysis with the sources of interest in the `eventmentions` table instead of the location of the event from the `events` table to speed up the query.

# 9/27/19 Zoom Meeting

First dicussion after group has been to perform queries against the `Events` table using MySQL Workbench for their section of the world. 

Continue working on tasks from Wednesday [link](#next-steps-and-tasks) 

## Issues raised and possible ways to address them
- Country code variables are of variable type `text` and may not be able to be indexed. 
    - Try using varchart to understand which data types are in the tables.
- MySQL Workbench is timing out during queries.
    - Using the correct configuration schema. 
- Queries taking a long time and not returning.
    - Limit the data to small date range. 

# 9/25/19 Zoom Meeting

**Summary** we went around the group discussing questions. You reported to me how the presentation to your professors went. I think that you are going to do great working on data analysis. 

- We plan to talk next on 9/27/19 at 11:30 am and Sutter will call me. 
- Please plan to come to [NPS Sloat Gate](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sloat+%2F+NPS+(Main+Gate)/@36.5943223,-121.8796447,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808de44992f0b8c9:0x295ef47715510e3a!8m2!3d36.594318!4d-121.877456) at the corner of Ninth St. and Sloat Ave. at 9:45am on 10/2/19. **Bring a Government-issued ID.**
- Try to devote 10 hours to this project (this includes our ZOOM meetings.) Record your work and hours in your work journal. 

## Questions and answers: 

1. What countries will each person work on? **Marco: West Africa, Sutter: East Africa, Max: Southeast Asia and South Pacific, Diego: South and Central Asia**
2. What coding language will the group work in? **Python**
3. What is the new name of the project? **Up to you all** - this [paper](http://dpi-proceedings.com/index.php/dtcse/article/view/23735) could give you some ideas.

## Next steps and tasks:

1. Go over the README.md file that Eric posted in the repo. 
    - Download MYSQL Workbench
    - Access the AWS bucket with the logon credentials listed in the README.md
    - Run your first code against the `Events` table
2. Begin your first query following the inquiry into the presence of activities of China in your countries.
    - Using the `Events` table run a query for which the following 2 criteria are met:
        1. China is either *Actor1CountryCode* or *Actor2CountryCode* (See [GDELT codebook](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf)) 
        2. Your target country is also listed as *Actor1CountryCode* or *Actor2CountryCode* or is listed under *Actor1Geo_CountryCode* or *Actor1Geo_CountryCode* or *ActionGeo_CountryCode*. 
    - Tally your results by country or by country-year if possible. 
        - As stated in [CountryCode info](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/CAMEO.Manual.1.1b3.pdf), the **CountryCode* variables use the 3-character UN country code. 
        - As stated in [GDELT codebook](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf), the **Geo_CountryCode* variables use the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code. 
        - It is likely the **Geo_CountryCode* variables are not indexed because Chris and Sebastian did not use them.
